# Serialization tests for OSCAR

This repository contains files generated by OSCAR's serialization code.
These files are used as part of the OSCAR test suite to verify that our
deserialization code remains backwards compatible with these older files.

Whenever someone adds support for a new type of objects in OSCAR, they
should add a test file here to ensure the upgrades work. If major changes
to the serialization format happen, then again a new file should be added.
The old files should be retained to verify our upgrade scripts can handle
them.
